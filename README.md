# Stone Challenge


Objectives:
- Create a t2-micro instance on AWS using any IAS platform (Cloudformation, Terraform, Ansible or the one you feel most comfortable with);
- Use good safety practices to ensure that this machine is not compromised or exposed to undue access;
- Create alarms to monitor both the basic capabilities of the machine (CPU, RAM) and whatever you find interesting;

Extras:
  - In the instance created, expose port 443 with some HTTP delivery service of your choice running (Apache, Nginx)
  - Terraform is a plus (using modules)
